### Get API key to access HERE Maps APIs (if you have an API key skip this)
#### Step 1: Login/Singup
* Create an account to access [HERE Developer Portal](https://developer.here.com/)
* go to [signup/login](https://developer.here.com/login)
* you will need to agree to [HERE Map's Terms of Service](https://legal.here.com/en-gb/terms)

#### Step 2: Getting your Key
* Login to your HERE Maps Developer Portal
* Go to https://developer.here.com/projects
* Select your project
* After selecting your project you need to select the service, select
  `REST APIs`


With this in place, make a GET request: https://router.hereapi.com/v8/routes?transportMode=car&origin=#{SOURCE[:latitude]},#{SOURCE[:longitude]}&destination=#{DESTINATION[:latitude]},#{DESTINATION[:longitude]}&apiKey=#{KEY}&return=polyline
### Note:
* HERE accepts source and destination, as `:` seperated `[:longitude,:latitude]`.
* HERE maps doesn't return us route as a `encoded polyline`, but as
  `flexible polyline`, we will convert from `flexible polyline` to
  `encoded polyline`. HERE maps doesn't have support for flexible polyline gem in ruby
* To decode `flexible polyline` we used HERE maps flexpolyline module and modified python script to make 
  it work for ruby

```ruby
// Polyline from JSON
polyline = json_parsed['routes'].map { |x| x['sections'] }.flatten(2). map { |y| y['polyline'] }.pop
here_decoded = decode(polyline)
google_encoded_polyline = FastPolylines.encode(here_decoded)
```

```ruby
require 'HTTParty'
require 'json'
require_relative 'flex_polyline'
require "fast_polylines"

# Source Details in latitude-longitude pair (Dallas, TX - coordinates)
SOURCE = {longitude: '-96.7970', latitude: '32.7767'}
# Destination Details in latitude-longitude pair (New York, NY - coordinates)
DESTINATION = {longitude: '-96.924', latitude: '32.9756' }

# GET Request to HERE Maps for Polyline
KEY = ENV['HERE_KEY']
HERE_URL = "https://router.hereapi.com/v8/routes?transportMode=car&origin=#{SOURCE[:latitude]},#{SOURCE[:longitude]}&destination=#{DESTINATION[:latitude]},#{DESTINATION[:longitude]}&apiKey=#{KEY}&return=polyline"
RESPONSE = HTTParty.get(HERE_URL).body
json_parsed = JSON.parse(RESPONSE)

# Extracting HERE polyline from JSON
polyline = json_parsed['routes'].map { |x| x['sections'] }.flatten(2). map { |y| y['polyline'] }.pop
# Using flex_polyline decode method to get coordinates
here_decoded = decode(polyline)
# Converting coordinates to google polyline
google_encoded_polyline = FastPolylines.encode(here_decoded)
```

Note:

We extracted the polyline for a route from HERE Maps API

We need to send this route polyline to TollGuru API to receive toll information

## [TollGuru API](https://tollguru.com/developers/docs/)

### Get key to access TollGuru polyline API
* create a dev account to [receive a free key from TollGuru](https://tollguru.com/developers/get-api-key)
* suggest adding `vehicleType` parameter. Tolls for cars are different than trucks and therefore if `vehicleType` is not specified, may not receive accurate tolls. For example, tolls are generally higher for trucks than cars. If `vehicleType` is not specified, by default tolls are returned for 2-axle cars. 
* Similarly, `departure_time` is important for locations where tolls change based on time-of-the-day.

the last line can be changed to following

```ruby
TOLLGURU_URL = 'https://dev.tollguru.com/v1/calc/route'
TOLLGURU_KEY = ENV['TOLLGURU_KEY']
headers = {'content-type' => 'application/json', 'x-api-key' => TOLLGURU_URL}
body = {'source' => "here", 'polyline' => google_encoded_polyline, 'vehicleType' => "2AxlesAuto", 'departure_time' => "2021-01-05T09:46:08Z"}
tollguru_response = HTTParty.post(TOLLGURU_URL,:body => body.to_json, :headers => headers)
```

The working code can be found in main.rb file.
